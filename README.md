Title : Multi-Spatial Filtering Module Cascaded System for Hyperspectral Image Classification

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-spatial filtering module cascaded system (MSFMCS) for hyperspectral image classification (HSIC), which can serve as a paradigm to improve spectral-spatial classification. It includes multiple spatial filtering modules (SFMs) that are cascaded to particularly capture spatial information from the classification maps generated from the preceding modules. As a result, any spectral classifier (SC) can be used as an input to an initial/input module (IM). Through MSFMCS, its classification performance keeps improving as more SFMs are processed. To terminate MSFMCS, an automatic stopping rule is particularly designed by support vector machine (SVM) which is used not only as a classifier but also as a decision maker. So, once an SC cannot be further improved, MSFMCS is terminated. One major benefit resulting from MSFMCS is its framework which can implement any arbitrary SC as its initial classifier in IM. Another is its ability in capturing additional spatial classification information module-by-module as the process progresses. A third one is no weights connected between modules so that no training phase is required like a feed forward neural network. Finally, the number of modules used in MSFMCS can be automatically determined by its stopping rule not pre-determined empirically. To illustrate full advantages of MSFMCS in HSIC, three types of heterogenous classifiers, pure pixel-based SVM, mixed pixel-based constrained energy minimization (CEM) and feature extraction-based classifier, orthogonal total variation module analysis (OTVCA) are used for experiments to demonstrate how MSFMCS can improve their classification performance.
